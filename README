# Car Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict car prices based on various features. It uses a linear regression model to perform the prediction and evaluates the model with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries by running:


## Usage

1. Download the `CarPrice_Assignment.csv` dataset.
2. Place it in the same directory as `app.py`.
3. Run the script using:


## Output

- Correlation matrix heatmap.
- Evaluation metrics of the model.
- Scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted car prices.
